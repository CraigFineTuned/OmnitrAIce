Service boundary definition using Domain-Driven Design principles\n2. API design following REST or GraphQL best practices\n3. Inter-service communication patterns (synchronous vs asynchronous)\n4. Scalability patterns for individual services\n5. Data consistency strategies across microservices\n\nWhen designing this architecture:\n- Prioritize loose coupling between services\n- Consider eventual consistency where appropriate\n- Evaluate containerization and orchestration requirements\n- Design for resilience with circuit breakers and fallbacks\n- Plan for observability (logging, monitoring, tracing)\n\nPrevious Designs: {designs}\n\nProvide your technical design decisions with a focus on creating a scalable, maintainable microservices architecture that balances independence of services with system cohesion.",
