## Project Details
- Name: TaskFlow
- Description: A task management system with real-time updates

## Development Timeline

CEO: After analyzing the requirements for TaskFlow, a task management system with real-time updates, I propose the following vision:

TaskFlow will be a modern, user-friendly task management system designed for teams with an emphasis on real-time collaboration. The key requirements include:

1. **Real-time Task Updates**: Tasks should update automatically across all user interfaces when changes are made by any team member.
2. **Team Collaboration**: The system must support multiple users with different roles and permissions.
3. **Intuitive User Interface**: A clean, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Notification System**: Customizable notifications for task assignments, updates, and deadlines.
5. **Data Visualization**: Dashboards showing project progress, task distribution, and timeline views.

Resources needed:
- Frontend Developer: 1
- Backend Developer: 1
- UI/UX Designer: 1
- QA Engineer: 0.5 (part-time)

Timeline:
- Planning & Design: 2 weeks
- Core Backend Development: 4 weeks
- Frontend Implementation: 4 weeks
- Testing & Refinement: 2 weeks
- Deployment: 1 week

Total estimated timeline: 13 weeks

Risk assessment:
- Real-time synchronization may increase complexity
- Mobile responsiveness could require additional testing
- User adoption may require comprehensive onboarding materials

This vision aligns with modern collaborative work environments and addresses the key requirement for real-time updates while maintaining usability.

ARCHITECT: Based on the CEO's vision for TaskFlow, I propose the following technical architecture:

## System Architecture

TaskFlow will be built using a modern, scalable architecture with the following components:

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React.js with Redux for state management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration using Socket.io
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI for consistent components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Build/Bundling**: Webpack with optimization for performance

### 2. Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: Node.js with Express
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io server
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based permissions
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization

### 3. Infrastructure Components
- **Hosting**: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
- **Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### 4. Key Technical Patterns
- **Microservices**: Separate services for authentication, task management, notifications
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using message queues for asynchronous operations
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate models for read and write operations
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Strategy Pattern**: For notification delivery methods

### 5. Integration Points
- **External Services**: 
  - Email service (SendGrid/Mailgun)
  - Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
  - Calendar integration (Google Calendar API)

### 6. Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDOS protection
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

This architecture prioritizes real-time capabilities, scalability, and clean separation of concerns to support the collaborative nature of the application while maintaining performance.
