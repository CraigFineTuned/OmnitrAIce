# Technical Architecture

## Project Details
- Name: TaskFlow
- Generated: 2025-02-28 14:55:00

## Architecture Overview

TaskFlow will be built using a modern, scalable architecture with the following components:

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React.js with Redux for state management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration using Socket.io
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI for consistent components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Build/Bundling**: Webpack with optimization for performance

### 2. Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: Node.js with Express
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io server
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based permissions
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization

### 3. Infrastructure Components
- **Hosting**: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
- **Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### 4. Key Technical Patterns
- **Microservices**: Separate services for authentication, task management, notifications
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using message queues for asynchronous operations
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate models for read and write operations
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Strategy Pattern**: For notification delivery methods

### 5. Integration Points
- **External Services**: 
  - Email service (SendGrid/Mailgun)
  - Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
  - Calendar integration (Google Calendar API)

### 6. Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDOS protection
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

This architecture prioritizes real-time capabilities, scalability, and clean separation of concerns to support the collaborative nature of the application while maintaining performance.
