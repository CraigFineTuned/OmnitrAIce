- Create basic layout components
- Develop WebSocket client integration
- Build responsive design system

### Phase 4: Task Management Features (Week 7-8)
- Implement task creation and editing UI
- Develop task listing and filtering components
- Create drag-and-drop task board
- Implement real-time task updates
- Build notifications UI

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 9-10)
- Develop dashboard with visualizations
- Implement calendar integration
- Create team collaboration features
- Build advanced filtering and search functionality
- Implement reporting tools

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization (Week 11-12)

## 3. Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Implementation
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control middleware
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- OAuth integration for social logins

### Real-time Updates Implementation
- Socket.io for WebSocket connections
- Redis pub/sub for scaling WebSocket across multiple instances
- Client-side event handlers for real-time UI updates
- Optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation

### Database Implementation
- MongoDB schemas with Mongoose
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Data validation at schema level
- Relation management between collections

### Frontend State Management
- Redux store with slice pattern
- Redux Toolkit for simplified state management
- Redux-Saga for side effects
- Normalized state shape for efficient updates

This implementation plan aligns with the architecture design and provides a clear roadmap for development while maintaining focus on the real-time capabilities, collaboration features, and user experience that are central to the TaskFlow vision.
